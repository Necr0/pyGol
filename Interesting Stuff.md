* Cellular Automata with a certain number of states and states can only cyclicly progress
* * example: DEAD->SPAWNING->ALIVE->DYING->DEAD
* * a singular set of rules that only determines the transfer to the next state with relative values to other states
* continuous cellular automata meaning continous values but still in a grid
